Constructing a todo list

1.) Created the html file with the link and script tags
and hard-coded our todo list.

2.) Created our js file with the following:
    lis var that consisted of document.querySelectorAll
    for loop
    3 different .addEventListener(mouseover and mouseout)

3.)Updated css by using .classList.add/toggle/remove to allow our css to manipulate the DOM instead of JS.
